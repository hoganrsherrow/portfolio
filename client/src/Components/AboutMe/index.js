                Hello! My name is Hogan, and I am an early career developer available for hire. My skills include full stack MERN and Spring development.
                My most recent experience is as a full stack developer for Hankook Tire America Corp where I worked in the Spring framework utilizing Java,
                Oracle SQL Database, JSP, JQuery/AJAX, HTML5/CSS3, and Redux to work on internal and B2B applications.

                After graduating from Vanderbilt University in 2020 with a degree in economics (where I was introduced to programming in Python and R), I
                began working for Amazon.com, Inc. as a corporate HR lead. I also began to work in freelance web development, honing my skills in Javascript,
                HTML5/CSS3, and PHP. Seeking to make a full shift into development, I returned to my alma mater and completed Vanderbilt University's Full Stack
                Coding Bootcamp. This bootcamp focused on the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), but it also taught GraphQl, ApolloServer,
                Redux, MySQL, and other technologies.
